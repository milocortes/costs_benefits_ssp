Transition to a renewable grid,"- Capex, non-fuel opex, and fuels are calculated endogenously

- $2.70/MWh of new transmission
","NemoMod calculates the least-cost pathway to a renewable grid, including capital, operations and maintenance, and fuel costs.

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Gorman et al., 2019), the levelized cost of new transmission in the US ranges from $1/MWh to $10/MWh. We use an average of $5/MWh and convert to LAC."
Produce green hydrogen,- Endogenously calculated in NemoMod based on increased demand for renewable electricity to produce hydrogen.,
Reduce transmission losses,- Varies by country,"The Inter-American Development Bank (Brichettei et al., 2021) estimates the cost between 2020 and 2030 of upgrading each countryâ€™s grid to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to 2030. We use a simple annual average as an approximation of the annual cost of upgrades in each country that would yield reductions in transmission losses.  "
Minimize fugitive emissions leaks,- $20/tCO2e,"Studies suggest that fugitive emissions could be abated for less than $14/tCO2e in the US oil and gas industry through various technologies (ICF International, 2014, Figures A-4 and A-5). We use a conservative estimate, given variations in discount rates, assumptions about methane prices, and so on."
Flare fugitive emissions,- $2/tCO2e,We assume flaring will be one-tenth the cost of fixing leaks.
