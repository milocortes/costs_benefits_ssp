(2012), and Daudey (2018). Average wastewater produced in LAC is based on Table 4 in Jones et al. (2021). We assume industrial wastewater treatment costs the same as domestic wastewater treatment per quantity of treated water. The full cost of safely managed sanitation in urban settings is the cost of the sanitation system (per capita) and the cost of treating the collected wastewater (per m3) using one of the wastewater treatment systems.

","Domestic sanitation and wastewater treatment costs are based on Tables D.1 and E.1 in Hutton & Varughese (2016), Table A.4.1 in Brichetti et al. (2021), Table 1 in Dodane et al. (2012), and Daudey (2018). Average wastewater produced in LAC is based on Table 4 in Jones et al. (2021). Here, the costs are given for each treatment option in isolation. So, wastewater that receives tertiary treatment will also receive primary and secondary treatment and incur those costs. 

We assume industrial wastewater treatment costs the same as domestic wastewater treatment per quantity of treated water. The cost of no treatment is the cost of collecting industrial wastewater and dumping it untreated into waterways. We estimated it as one-tenth the cost of sewerage (i.e., safely managed urban sanitation) on a per cubic meter basis.

Biogas capture,$17/million British thermal units (MBtu) of biogas,"IEA (2020f) provides a global average cost of biogas capture at wastewater treatment facilities of $10.30/MBTU in capex and $4.30/MBTU in opex, which we convert to 2019 dollars in LAC."
