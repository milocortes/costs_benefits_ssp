Household grocery costs from improved diets,- $385 per person per year transitioned to a better diet,"The annual cost of food in the improved diet described by Springmann et al., (2016) is less than the existing average diet, with food prices in LAC based on Springmann et al. (2017) and adjusted to 2019 dollars."
Health benefits of better diets,"- $1,750/per person per year transitioned to a better diet
","The health benefits of a dietary change is calculated based on the aggregate annual health benefits defined in Springmann et al. (2016) for LAC in 2050. The costs are deeply uncertain: a direct-costs approach estimates costs of $100B in LAC; a value-of-statistical-life approach estimates costs of approximately $2.5 trillion (see Figures S.12 and S.13) divided by the population in LAC projected by the World Bank for 2050 (approximately 750 million). We use an average, but explore the full range, from $350/person to $3,500/person."
