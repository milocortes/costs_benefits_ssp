(LAC average in 2019)",Notes and data sources
Electrify LDVs,"- $0.039/vehicle-kilometer (vkm) in capital cost, declining over time

- $0.012/vkm in maintenance cost (i.e., savings)","These costs reflect the marginal capital and maintenance costs of EVs versus internal combustion engine (ICE) LDVs per km. In the US, light-duty EVs are estimated to have $12,000 of higher up-front cost (Baik et al., 2019) than traditional LDVs and have $949/year lower maintenance costs (AAA, 2019) than their ICE counterparts. We approximate that charging infrastructure may involve an additional $1,000 in capital costs per EV, consistent with data from the US on the costs (Purnazeri, 2022) and deployment of charging stations (Evadoption, 2021). The per-km capital cost shown in the table assumes vehicles are driven 15,000 km/year (Ecola et al., 2008, Ecola et al, 2012, Ecola et al., 2014) and have a 12-year lifespan, consistent with data on vehicle lifetimes in the US (BTS, undated). Then costs are adjusted to 2019 costs for LAC.

Fuel switch MDVs and HDVs,"- $0.042/vkm + $0.011/kWh in capital cost, declining over time

- $0.02/vkm in maintenance cost (i.e., savings)","Burke et al. (2022) provide marginal capital and maintenance costs of a variety of medium- and heavy-duty battery electric vehicles (BEVs) versus ICEs (Table 19a, p. 50), and the cost of charging infrastructure (p. 22). Using a stated 12-year lifetime, we calculate a simple average of these costs across all vehicle types. Then costs are adjusted to 2019 costs for LAC."
Electrify rail,"- $0.0013/metric ton per kilometer (mtkm) or pkm in capital cost

- $0.0002/mtkm or pkm in maintenance cost (i.e., savings)","Popovich et al. (2021) estimate the capital and maintenance costs of electrifying freight rail. In absence of other information, we assume that electrifying passenger rail will have similar costs per person-km, with a lower mass of passengers compared to freight offset by climate control, lower density, and other variables."
Fuel switch maritime,- $0.0005/mtkm,"Carlo et al. (2020) estimate that decarbonizing the maritime industry (using ammonia as the primary fuel) by 2050 will cost roughly $1 trillion, with 55% of that cost associated with ammonia production and storage and ship-related investments (Krantz et al, 2020). Here, 45% of the cost is associated with hydrogen production, which we account for in energy production. They also estimate a total demand of approximately 500,000-billion-tonnautical miles of demand. We use this data to approximate a cost of fuel switching per MTKM of total goods movement and apply this to LAC."
Increase energy efficiency,"- $0.88M/PJ, equivalent to $0.002/vkm for ICE LDVs","The National Research Council (2015) estimates the technical cost and percent fuel economy improvements for LDVs from a wide range of vehicle technologies, including power train, accessories, and vehicle mass. We estimate the average cost per improvement across all technologies and calculate a per-km cost assuming a 12-year vehicle lifetime and 15,000 km/year use. Assuming a fuel economy of 12km/l, we calculate a cost per unit of energy saved and, in the absence of other data, apply this to other modes and fuel types."
Increase occupancy for private vehicles,,There are no technical costs associated with increasing private vehicle occupancy; the savings (from avoided costs of transport by auto) are calculated in the system costs. 
"- Mode shift freight 

- Mode shift local and regional passenger travel
",,"The technical costs and savings of freight and passenger mode shifting are a combination of the following: the system cost for providing transport by different modes, the additional cost of expanding infrastructure associated with certain modes of the transport system (e.g., rail transport) to account for added demand; and the cost savings of avoided infrastructure expansion in modes with less demand (e.g., air transport). Quantifying these effects is deeply uncertain, highly localized, and beyond this studyâ€™s scope. We note, however, that mode shifts could result in a net cost savings, given that the shifts are generally from modes that are infrastructure inefficient (e.g., personal autos) to modes that are more infrastructure efficient (e.g., transit)."
