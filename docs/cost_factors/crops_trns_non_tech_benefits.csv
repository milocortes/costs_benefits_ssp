Avoided nitrate leaching and runoff,- $60/ton of fertilizer avoided,"Good and Beatty (2011, Box 2 and Table 4) estimate the total environmental cost of nitrate leaching and runoff to be 44% of the total cost of excess fertilizer applied, of which 70% of is attributed to nitrate leaching and runoff. The value of avoided nitrate leaching and runoff is estimated at 30% of the per-ton cost of fertilizer in the prior table.

Improved soil health,- $350/ha,"Telles et al. (2018) estimate the difference in agricultural land values in Brazil in 2006 under different tillage practices. They find that on average, hectares of no-till are over $700 more valuable per acre than those under conventional tillage practices, which can serve as a proxy for the benefits of healthier soils from conservation tillage. Recognizing that agricultural land values vary greatly by country and that the causal direction of the relationship between value of land and tillage practice may be complex, we use a conservative estimate of the difference to value the benefits of this practice."
