Forests and Land Use
======================

Forest emissions include CO2 sequestration in biomass in primary and secondary forests, as well as harvested wood products, CH4 from mangrove ecosystems, and CO2 from forest fires. Land-use emissions include CO2 emissions derived from converting forest land to other types of land. Land-use changes are specified using a transition matrix for all land-use types and modeled in response to changing demands for livestock and crops. Forestry is divided into primary forest, secondary forests, and mangroves. These categories reflect an aggregation of forestry types into emission-relevant categories. Land-use types include croplands, grasslands, settlements, wetlands, forests-mangroves, forests-primary, and forests-secondary.
