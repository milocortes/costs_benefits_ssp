Costs Benefits Analysis documentation
=====================================

The Costs and Benefits module belongs to the SISEPUEDE (sImulation of sEctoral Pathways and Uncertainty Exploration for dEcarbonization) decarbonization toolbox. 

The module evaluate the Costs and Benefits of bottom-up transformations (decarbonization options) using estimates found in the literature of their costs and benefits. 

This includes technical costs or benefits that actors generally experience within a sector and also generally are internal to markets, such as the cost to the agricultural sector of capturing biogas from livestock, the cost of increasing energy efficiency in industry, or the cost of investments in the electricity sector for new capacity to keep up with growing demand. We also include non-technical costs or benefits that are paramount to aligning decarbonization with development goals, such as health benefits of avoided automobile crashes and air pollution, the value of conserving biodiversity, or the time saved thanks to less congestion :cite:p:`fazekas2022achieving`.

Table 2.4 presents a summary of the costs and benefits of transformations across different sectors. Appendices A-G provide additional detail on each of these performance metrics, costs,
and benefits.
