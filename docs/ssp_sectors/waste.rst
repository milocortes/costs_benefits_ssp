Waste
======================

The waste sector consists of solid and liquid waste from domestic and industrial sources. The emissions from this sector depend upon the quantity of waste produced, the composition of that waste, and the pathways by which that waste is handled. Correspondingly, emissions reductions can be achieved by reducing the amount of waste produced, altering the waste’s composition to have lower emissions potential, improving waste-treatment methods, and returning some portion of the waste stream back into the economy in the form of reused or recycled inputs.


Wastewater
======================

Wastewater is produced by industrial and domestic sources. For industrial sources, wastewater management is defined by various levels of treatment, as Table G.1 describes. These treatments are consistent with the systems and discharge pathways described in the wastewater chapters of the IPCC’s 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the subsequent 2019 Refinement (Eggleston et al., 2006; Zhongming et al., 2019).
For domestic users, wastewater management consists of sanitation and wastewater treatment. The World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene describes a sanitation ladder with five rungs—from (1) open defecation (OD) to (2) unimproved, (3) limited, (4) basic, and (5) safely managed sanitation. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.2.1a seeks universal access to safely managed sanitation (WHO, 2021), but that means different pathways for urban and rural users, as Table G.2 shows.
In urban settings, safely managed sanitation generally involves sewers that collect household wastewater for subsequent centralized treatment using one of the categories of treatment options described in Table G.1. In rural settings, collection is generally cost prohibitive, so safely managed sanitation includes on-site treatment, e.g., in septic tanks with fecal sludge management. For this study, we have bundled rungs 1 and 2 into an “unimproved” sanitation category and rungs 3 and 4 into an “improved” sanitation category.

Solid Waste
======================

Solid waste is generated by consumption. Growth in domestic consumption is driven by GDP per capita, while growth in industrial consumption is driven by production (represented by value added). Solid waste streams are disaggregated by subtype—such as wood, paper, or food—and can be managed in several pathways (see Table G.7), consistent with the systems and discharge pathways described in the waste chapters IPCC’s 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the subsequent 2019 refinement. Emissions are calculated using specific emissions factors for each waste stream subtype managed in each system, consistent with the methodology and factors in the IPCC Guidelines.
