Transport
======================

Transportation consists of different categories (or modes) of transportation used to satisfy various demands, and emissions from mobile combustion of fuels are highly dependent on the technologies (e.g., types of vehicles) that use the fuels. Therefore, emission factors for mobile combustion of fuels are contained in the Transportation rather than Energy Fuels subsector.
