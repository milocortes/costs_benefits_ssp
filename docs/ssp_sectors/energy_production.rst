Energy Production
=====================================

The electricity and fuel production sector assesses the demands and emissions associated with both primary and secondary energy, and the costs of transforming them. The electricity sector is modeled differently from other sectors using NemoMod, an energy framework developed by the Stockholm Environmental Institute (Veysey et al., 2023). NemoMod takes as input varous drivers and data, including demands, residual generation capacities, capacity and availability factors, capital and operating costs, emission factors, and a series of constraints and generates a least-cost pathway to meet demand contingent on constraints.
