Agriculture
======================

The agricultural sector consists of crop and livestock production. The demand for crops and
livestock is driven by population and GDP growth. Crops and livestock are distinguished by type
according to FAO categories. We discuss crop and livestock production separately.

Crosscutting Agriculture Supply-and-Demand Transformations
======================

Several transformations shape the underlying supply, demand, and productivity of the
agricultural system and can have significant impacts on emissions. They include shifting
consumer diets to reduce meat consumption, reducing food losses and waste, improving
productivity, and changing agricultural land-use policy.

Table A.8 shows these transformations, and Table A.9 shows their technical costs and
benefits. Table A.10 shows the sector-specific non-technical costs and benefits. The costs and
benefits of these transformations on land use are described in the land use and forestry sector.
