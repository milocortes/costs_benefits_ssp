Buildings
======================

This sector includes energy consumed by residential, commercial, and municipal buildings, and other stationery combustion not captured elsewhere. The emissions from this sector depend upon the building stock and population, and the demands for heating, cooling, and other appliances in the building, and the source of energy used. Residential building stock is estimated as a function of population and occupancy rate, which is elastic to GDP per capita. Emissions reductions can be achieved by reducing the amount of energy required in buildings, increasing their energy efficiency, and using cleaner energy sources.
