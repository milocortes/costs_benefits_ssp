Industry
======================

Industry includes production of cement, chemical products, construction and demolition, electronics, glass, metals, and other products and product uses. The emissions from this sector depend upon the quantity of product demanded, the emissions associated with industrial processes to create that product, the amount of energy needed to enable those processes, and the sources of energy used. Correspondingly, emissions reductions can be achieved by reducing the amount of product created, using lower-emitting input materials and processes, increasing the processes’ energy efficiency, and using cleaner energy sources.
